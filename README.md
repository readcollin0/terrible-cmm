A C-- compiler for RISC-V

I have never written a compiler before.
I have never studied compilers.
I have never written a big program in Common Lisp.

And so, I decided to write a compiler in Common Lisp. It's built to target specifically the RISC-V processor built in my EC EN 323 class at BYU, which doesn't implement all of the instructions. I also didn't want to write a full C compiler, as that's too much work for the weekend I had to do it. And so, I made C--.

Look at the source at your own risk. I don't know how to write good Lisp code.
Learn the language at your own. I don't have experience in language design, or compilers, so I had to make it easy to compile.

Documentation (probably) coming soon.
